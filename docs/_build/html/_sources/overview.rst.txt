Overview
========

The Emergent AI Society Simulator is a multi-agent simulation project that
demonstrates how complex societal behaviors can emerge from simple autonomous
agent interactions in a shared world environment.

Project Goals
-------------

This project aims to:

* Demonstrate emergent behavior in multi-agent systems
* Showcase design pattern implementations in a practical context
* Model societal progression through technological eras
* Provide a framework for studying agent-based economic and social systems

Core Concepts
-------------

Agent Behavior Cycle
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Agents follow a three-phase behavioral cycle:

1. **Sense**: Detect nearby resources, other agents, and environmental threats
2. **Decide**: Choose actions based on their decision policy (selfish, cooperative, AI-driven)
3. **Act**: Execute chosen actions like gathering, trading, moving, attacking, or forming alliances

Technological Progression
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The simulation models three distinct technological eras:

**Stone Age**
   Basic survival, hunting/gathering, small tribal structures

**Agricultural Era**
   Farming development, permanent settlements, larger populations, increased trade

**Industrial Era**
   Specialization, advanced production systems, complex societies

Technology spreads through discovery, learning from others, and trade networks.

Emergent Outcomes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

From simple behavioral rules, complex patterns emerge:

* Economic markets and sophisticated trade networks
* Social hierarchies and factional systems
* Territorial competition and resource conflicts
* Knowledge diffusion across different societies

Analysis & Reporting
--------------------

The simulation provides comprehensive analysis tools:

* **Event Logging**: Tracking of trades, conflicts, alliances, and technological discoveries
* **End Reports**: Analysis of wealth distribution, faction stability, and technology timelines
* **Strategy Comparison**: Evaluation of different agent strategies and their societal outcomes
