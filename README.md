# Emergent AI Society Simulator

**CS455 Design Patterns - Final Project**

A multi-agent simulation demonstrating emergent societal behaviors through autonomous agent interactions in a shared world environment.

## Overview

The Emergent AI Society Simulator showcases how simple autonomous agents can produce complex societal behaviors like economies, factions, and conflicts through their interactions. Agents begin in a primitive Stone Age and can progress through technological eras (Agricultural â†’ Industrial) as they innovate and cooperate. This project emphasizes clean architecture and design patterns with text-based output for analysis.

## Features

### Core Simulation
- **Grid World Environment**: Agents exist in a resource-rich world with food, materials, and water
- **Agent Traits**: Each agent has unique characteristics including strength, intelligence, and sociability
- **Discrete Time Steps**: Simulation progresses through structured time intervals
- **Emergent Behaviors**: Complex societal patterns emerge from simple interaction rules

### Agent Behavior System
Agents follow a three-phase behavioral cycle:
1. **Sense**: Detect nearby resources, other agents, and environmental threats
2. **Decide**: Choose actions based on their decision policy (selfish, cooperative, AI-driven)
3. **Act**: Execute chosen actions like gathering, trading, moving, attacking, or forming alliances

### Technological Progression
- **Stone Age**: Basic survival, hunting/gathering, small tribal structures
- **Agricultural Era**: Farming development, permanent settlements, larger populations, increased trade
- **Industrial Era**: Specialization, advanced production systems, complex societies

Technology spreads through discovery, learning from others, and trade networks.

### Emergent Outcomes
From simple behavioral rules, complex patterns emerge:
- Economic markets and sophisticated trade networks
- Social hierarchies and factional systems
- Territorial competition and resource conflicts
- Knowledge diffusion across different societies

### Analysis & Reporting
- **Event Logging**: Comprehensive tracking of trades, conflicts, alliances, and technological discoveries
- **End Reports**: Detailed analysis of wealth distribution, faction stability, and technology timelines
- **Strategy Comparison**: Evaluation of different agent strategies and their societal outcomes
